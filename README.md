# snakemake_scripts

My collection snakemake scripts for processing various types of (for now) sequencing data.

The paired_end_rnaseq.snakefile is probably the best example of a working script.  Currently, it is designed to handle data generated from KAPA Hyperprep RNA-seq libraries sequenced on Illumina Nextseq/Novaseq sequencers.
